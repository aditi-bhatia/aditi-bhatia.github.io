                <p> <b>Winner: UCI Multidisciplinary Design Program Research Grant (2014, 2015, 2016)</p></b>

                <p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are the fastest growing group of developmental disabilities and are considered a major public health concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that the prevalence of autism in the United States has risen from 1 in 150 births in 2002 to 1 in 88 births in 2012. Individuals with ASDs typically have difficulties in social interaction, communication skills, emotion regulation, as well as motor and cognitive functioning. Some children with ASDs, however, have been found to have enhanced musical understanding due to their special pitch memory, labeling and discrimination. In typically developing children, substantial evidence supports that musical experiences have direct or indirect impact on various domains of development, in that multiple systems are stimulated and integrated including language, social-emotional, motor, sensory-perceptual, and behavioral domains. Music therapy has thus been incorporated into 12% of autism interventions and 45% of alternative treatment strategies. Most musical experiences are generated between a musical therapist and a child with autism. In prior studies, parents have been invited to participate in some music therapy sessions; however, they were not consistently and actively involved in the music therapy. Because children’s social and emotional development is proposed to arise out of repeated socio-emotional experiences in their relationships with their caregiver, parent involvement may increase the impact as lack of parent engagement during musical therapy may become a barrier for a child with autism to maintain or generate the skills acquired with a musical therapist in a home setting.</p>
                <p>This product was designed to be accessible and useful for everyday, tactile, interactive musical therapy between the child with ASD and parent. We hypothesize that this will lead to a more participatory experience between the parent and child, and that this experience can provide benefits over traditional musical therapy (where sessions are mostly an interaction between a therapist and child, and where the music is experienced passively by the child). To achieve this goal, we have designed and built novel, child-friendly music toys that have sensors embedded into them. The sensors connect and can be interfaced with a computer that runs music software such as Garageband. A number of toy designs have been explored and were tested with children to learn how they interact with these musical instruments, and optimize their effectiveness. </p>
